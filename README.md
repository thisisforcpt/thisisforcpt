# About my first project on GitHub

So far the idea is to make a social media site in which users can invest in posts, the better the posts preform, the more they earn, if a post performs badly they lose money. 

idea #1:
    pay to access every functionality in the app
    1 hajcoin - like
    2 hajcoin - comment
    5 hajcoin - post something
    ad free
    no data sold to external companies
    hajcoin value - 1 coin: 0.10 dollars 
    the money from one post is divided as follows: 60% creator, 30% website, 10% charity
    posting something the money is divided as follows: 60% website, 40% charity

idea #2:
    invest in posts (YOU DO NOT OWN POSTS)
    better they do the more money they make
    if they dont do good or dont do as good you make a net zero or a loss
    ads in the website
    data sold to external companies

# CHATGPT / COPILOT ACKNOLEDGEMENT

- CHATGPT utilised for some documentation and in assistance in coding
- USED TO ASSIST IN CODING AND MAKE A COUPLE OF FEATURES SUCH AS LOGIN/SIGNUP, FRIENDS PAGE AND OTHER APPLICATION FEATURES
- I used ChatGPT here and there while building this website. Mostly to help with fixing tricky bits of code, trying out design ideas, and getting past a few bugs. It didn’t build the site for me, but it was definitely helpful for brainstorming and getting unstuck when I needed a hand.
